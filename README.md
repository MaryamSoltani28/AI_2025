# AI_2025
This is where I’m keeping all my work from the AI course – exercises, mini-projects, and bigger projects. It’s a mix of code and ideas I’ve picked up along the way, showing how AI algorithms and techniques can solve different problems. Each project has some notes to explain what’s going on, so feel free to check them out or contribute if you’d like!
